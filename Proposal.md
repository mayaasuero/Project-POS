Brief Description of the Program:

Running a business means facing an ongoing series of ever-evolving challenges. It can be risky, and not all businesses succeed. New businesses often fail during the early years. Keeping an accurate inventory is one of the challenges for start-up-businesses. This document proposes a program that gives business owners a convenient way of checking out customers and of recording sales. The proposed program can keep a record of the store inventory and eases the flow at checkout terminals, while recording all the information that can help business owners be more efficient in managing their businesses. This proposal includes a brief description, functionalities and features, and the possible data structures and algorithms which will be utilized for the program implementation.

Functionalities and features:

This Point of Sales (POS) program will give business owners a convenient way of checking out and recording their sales real time. It can keep a record of the store inventory, updating it whenever an order is processed. This program can help ease the flow at checkout terminals, while recording all the information that can help small to medium business owners be more efficient in managing their businesses.

Features:

Possible data structures and algorithms to be used:

The possible data structures and algorithms that can be used in this program includes: 
-	an array which will store the different products the store offers 
-	algorithms that can add or delete certain elements in a tree to replicate the process different transactions
-	objects and classes for the implementation of a tree data structure
- searching algorithm * (consult with group)
-	files in recording previous transactions conducted by the program
